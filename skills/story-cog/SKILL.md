# Story Cog - Storytelling Powered by CellCog

Create compelling stories with AI - from short fiction to novels to screenplays to immersive worlds.

## How to Use

For your first CellCog task in a session, read the **cellcog** skill for the full SDK reference — file handling, chat modes, timeouts, and more.

**OpenClaw (fire-and-forget):**
```python
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
)
```

**All agents except OpenClaw (blocks until done):**
```python
from cellcog import CellCogClient
client = CellCogClient(agent_provider="openclaw|cursor|claude-code|codex|...")
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
)
print(result["message"])
```

|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Fantasy** | Magic, world building, epic scope | Deep world creation, consistent magic systems |

## Chat Mode for Stories

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Short stories, scenes, character work, outlines | `"agent"` |
| Complex narratives, novel development, deep world building | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most creative writing.** Short stories, individual scenes, and character development execute well in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for narrative complexity** - novel-length outlines, intricate plot development, or multi-layered world building that benefits from deep thinking.

## Tips for Better Stories

1. **Genre expectations**: Readers have expectations. Honor them or subvert them intentionally, but know what they are.

2. **Character drives plot**: Give CellCog clear character motivations. Plot emerges from characters wanting things.

3. **Specific details**: "A coffee shop" is generic. "A coffee shop with mismatched furniture and a cat named Hemingway" is memorable.

4. **Emotional truth**: Even in fantasy, the emotions should feel real. Specify the emotional journey you want.

5. **Show, don't tell**: Ask for scenes, not summaries. "Write the moment she realizes..." not "Describe that she was sad."

6. **Iterate**: First drafts are starting points. Use CellCog to revise, expand, and refine.
